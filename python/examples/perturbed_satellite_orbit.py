## Context
"""
This example demonstrates the propagation of a (quasi-massless) body dominated by a central point-mass attractor, but also including multiple perturbing accelerations exerted by the central body as well as third bodies.

The example showcases the ease with which a simulation environment can be extended to a multi-body system. It also demonstrates the wide variety of acceleration types that can be modelled using the propagation_setup.acceleration module, including accelerations from non-conservative forces such as drag and radiation pressure. Note that the modelling of these acceleration types requires special environment interfaces (implemented via `add_aerodynamic_coefficient_interface()`, `add_radiation_pressure_interface()`) of the body undergoing the accelerations.

It also demonstrates and motivates the usage of dependent variables. By keeping track of such variables throughout the propagation, valuable insight, such as contributions of individual acceleration types, ground tracks or the evolution of Kepler elements, can be derived in the post-propagation analysis.

The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded. These are `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.

Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refere to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

- Aerodynamic acceleration caused by the atmosphere of the Earth (using the aerodynamic interface defined earlier).

### Create the propagator settings
"""
The propagator is finally setup.

First, a termination condition is defined so that the propagation will stop when the end epochs that was defined is reached.

## Propagate the orbit
"""
The orbit is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `SingleArcSimulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation module`.
This function requires the `bodies`, `integrator_settings`, and `propagator_settings` that have all been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:
- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
- Columns 1 to 3: Position history, in meters, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.
- Columns 4 to 6: Velocity history, in meters per second, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.

The same is done with the dependent variable history. The column indexes corresponding to a given dependent variable in the `dep_vars` variable are printed when the simulation is run, when `SingleArcSimulator()` is called.
Do mind that converting to an ndarray using the `result2array()` utility will shift these indexes, since the first column (index 0) will then be the times.
