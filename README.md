# Mission Analysis

You can find the complete mission analysis document on Valispace [here](https://tolosat.valispace.com/project/26/analyses/32).

## Mission statement
The Mission Analysis subsystem is dedicated to the following tasks :
- Select and define the orbit in which the spacecraft shall be injected at launch.
- Propagate the spacecraft trajectory, compute eclipses, communication windows and supply position & velocity data for other simulations.
- Analyse the evolution of the orbit in the short- and long-term to ensure compliance with regulations and mission requirements.
- Identify how the evolution of the orbit impacts mission operations and payloads performance.
- Provide other subsystems with support and training in orbital mechanics to help them ensure their subsystem is able to satisfy performance requirements in the short and long-term.
