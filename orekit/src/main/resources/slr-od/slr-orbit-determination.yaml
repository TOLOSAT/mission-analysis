  # convergence is reached when max|p(k+1) - p(k)| < ε for each normalized estimated
  # parameters p and iterations k and k+1 so the ε threshold
  # Normalized values are computed as (x - x0) / sx, so convergence is reached when
  # the following condition holds for all estimated parameters: |x[i+1] - x[i]| <= ε * sx
  # So the convergence threshold specified here can be considered as a multiplication
  # factor applied to scale. Since for all parameters the scale is often small,
  # then the threshold should not be too small. A value  of 10⁻³ is often quite accurate.
