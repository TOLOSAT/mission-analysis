# Launch Year - Mission Duration
This script uses the STELA propagator to compute mean keplerian elements through the entire mission duration for a set of launch years covering more than a solar cycle (12 years). This allows to see the extrema mission durations depending on when the launch occurs relative to the solar cycle.
